# How to Talk to Your Oshi in Online Event (22/7 Edition)

So you want to meet your oshi (fave) in an online event they're holding. Maybe spiral into talk/cheki (polaroid)/sign (autograph)-kai hell as well.
You have come to the right place! Look no further to this shitty guide. 

In this guide, we will cover three things:

1. [Signing up on FortuneMusic](#signing-up-for-fortunemeets)
2. [Getting tickets](#getting-tickets)
3. Downloading and using the FortuneMeets app

**NOTE**: This guide will assume you have a _Tenso (proxy service) or a Japanese address_ you can use to have items shipped to you. If you don't, go apply for one first. 
Any specific questions on how to sign up can be answered at the #events chat at the [22/7 Discord](https://discord.gg/227) server.

ok let's get started :point_down: :sunglasses: :point_down:

   2. The name form below is the reading of your name in furigana so put your name in katakana. Use an [online keyboard](https://www.lexilogos.com/keyboard/katakana.htm) if you have to. Or have someone transliterate it for you. **NOTE: family name (last name) goes first, given name goes last.**
   3. Put in your email. This will be your login id. Enter it again in the text form below
   4. Password. Then confirm password.
   5. This is where you need your Tenso address. But you'll only need to type in the postal code and click the green button. The only last three you'll only need to copy and paste from your Tenso address. (TL Note: denwa bangou means telephone number. use the number from your Tenso.)
![step3b](https://i.imgur.com/buIxbvp.png)
   6. Finish up by choosing your gender (Male or Female), inputting date of birth, and choosing if you want to get bombarded with spam. Click the green button on the bottom.
![step3c](https://i.imgur.com/6xUDoP7.png)
   7. You will need to go to your email to confirm registration. Go check your email and look for the registration confirmation email. Click on that link.
   8. Congrats you're finished. But not quite! You need to add your credit card info!
   9. When you get to the screen after clicking the link on your confirmation email, go to the first grey box.
   10. Type in your credit card details. Card number, expiration date, name on card and security code. Do the captcha too.
   11. ok *now* you're done

## Getting Tickets
so now you wanna talk to your oshi. maybe get an autograph from them

before we start i wanna clarify a few things. 

1. Talk-kai and Cheki/Sign-kai are **different events**. You won't get an autograph if you attend a Talk-kai event lmao.
2. There are different days/times when those go on.
3. The latter is more expensive. 

got it? got it.
